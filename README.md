# Azure DevOps Wiki Editor

Chrome Extension enables WYSIWYG editor in Azure DevOps markdown wiki. Based on great work of [Toast UI Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor).

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Google Chrome browser

## 🛠️ How to Build

### 🔧 Development Build

To build the development version of the extension, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bthos/azure-devops-wiki-editor.git
   cd azure-devops-wiki-editor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Development Version**:
   Run the following command to build the development version of the extension:
   ```sh
   npm run dev-build
   ```

This will create a development build in the `dist/` directory. The development build includes source maps and unminified code for easier debugging.

### 📦 Production Build

To build the production version of the extension, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   If you haven't already, install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Clean the Build Directory** (Optional):
   ```sh
   npm run clean
   ```

3. **Build the Production Version**: 
   Run the following command to build the production version of the extension:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

This will create a production build in the `dist/` directory. The production build is optimized with minified code and no source maps. It also creates a ZIP file ready for distribution.

## 💻 Development Server

To test the editor functionality locally before installing it as a Chrome extension:

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run server
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   `http://localhost:8080/test.html`

3. You'll see a test page with the WYSIWYG editor where you can try out the features without needing to install the extension.

## 🧪 Testing the Extension

### 🔍 Local Testing

1. Build the extension using either the development or production build steps above
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button
5. Select the `dist/` directory where the build files are located
6. Navigate to any Azure DevOps wiki page
7. Try editing a page to verify the WYSIWYG editor appears and functions correctly
8. Test the following features:
   - Basic text formatting (bold, italic, lists)
   - Creating and editing tables

### ❗ Troubleshooting

If the editor doesn't appear:
1. Check the browser's console for any error messages
